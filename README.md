# Toxicity Detection in Gaming Chats Using Machine Learning and Large Language Models  
### CMPE 255 — Data Mining Short Story Assignment  
**Author:** Siddharth Rao Kartik  

---

## 📘 Project Overview  
This repository contains my CMPE 255 *Data Mining Short Story Assignment*, based on the paper  
**“A Comparative Study on Toxicity Detection in Gaming Chats Using Machine Learning and Large Language Models”**  
by Yehor Tereshchenko and Mika Hämäläinen (Metropolia University of Applied Sciences, 2025).  

The project explores how different machine learning and large-language-model (LLM) architectures detect toxic or abusive content in online gaming chats.  
It compares traditional ML, fine-tuned transformers, and zero-shot LLM approaches using metrics such as accuracy, latency, and computational cost.

## 🧠 Core Data Mining Concepts  
This project demonstrates the following data-mining and machine-learning principles:  
- Text classification and feature extraction  
- Clustering and frequent-pattern mining  
- Dimensionality reduction via embeddings  
- Anomaly detection of toxic patterns  
- Model evaluation metrics (precision, recall, F1-score)  

---

## 🧩 Paper Summary  
- Fine-tuned **DistilBERT** achieved the best balance of speed, accuracy, and compute cost.  
- **LLMs** performed well in flexible detection but were slower and resource-heavy.  
- **Traditional ML models** were efficient but struggled with sarcasm and context.  
- The paper recommends a **hybrid AI + human moderation** system for scalable, fair chat filtering.
